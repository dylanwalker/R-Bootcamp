## R as a calculator 

```{r}
8 * 7
```

```{r}
10 / 5 + 5
```

```{r}
10 / (5 + 5)
```

```{r}
pi
```

```{r}
sin(pi/6)
```

## Create new objects by "`<-`"

```{r}
x <- 4
```

```{r}
x
```

All R statements where you create objects, assignment statements, have the same form:

`myObject <- value`

When reading that code say "myObject gets value" in your head.

Shortcut: **Alt** + **-** results in ` <- `

## Calling functions
R has a large collection of built-in functions that are called like this:

```FunctionName(arg1 = val1, arg2 = val2, ...)```

```{r}
seq(1, 100)
```

```{r}
#?seq
```

```{r}
seq(0, 100, length.out = 5)
```

```{r}
seq(0, 100, by = 10)
```

```{r}
myList <- seq(0, 100, by = 10)
```

```{r}
myList
```

```{r}
(myList <- seq(0, 100, by = 10))
```
Note in the above, this assigns the sequence to myList and "returns it" (i.e., it returns its value, which causes it to be displayed "as if we had typed `myList`" on an empty line. You can also uses this "assign and return" in more complicated ways.

```{r}
myChar <- "hello world"
```

```{r}
myChar
```

Now look at your RStudio *environment" tab in the upper right pane:

### Exercise 1
Tweak each of the following R commands so that they run correctly:

```
ggplot(dota = mpg) 
  + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

fliter(mpg, cyl = 8)

filter(diamond, carat > 3)
```

---

In RStudio press Alt + Shift + K to get all the shortcuts.


### Commenting along the code
Use "#" followed by a space and your comment. R won't read anything after "#"

```{r}
# This is a comment. It's a good practice to leave a space after the pound sign for redability
```

One can also leave a comment after the code in the same line. A good practice is to leave 2 spaces after the code, hash tag, a single space, and then comment. E.g.:

```{r}
accountBalance <- 100
accountBalance <- accountBalance + 500  # adding 500 to accountBalance
accountBalance
```

## Common data types in R
There are several data types associated with objects in R. We can identify the class of data types in these objects by `class()` function. Everything in R is an object, so we can use `class()` on any object.

* Numeric
* Integer
* Logical (boolean)
* Character

### Numeric
Decimal objects

Note: If integers are not explicitly declared as integers they will be considered in numeric class as well.

```{r}
x1 <- 2.2
class(x1)
```

```{r}
x2 <- 2
class(x2)
```

```{r}
is.integer(x2)
```

### Integer
To work with integer class we can use `as.integer()` to explicitly set an integer class:

```{r}
y1 <- as.integer(2)
class(y1)
```

```{r}
is.integer(y1)
```

One could also use `L` notation:

```{r}
y2 <- 3L
print(y2)
class(y2)
```

### Logical (boolean)

```{r}
a <- TRUE
a
```

```{r}
T
```

```{r}
b <- FALSE
b
```

```{r}
F
```

```{r}
class(b)
```

### Characters
We can use double quotes or single quotes to define characters

```{r}
myChar <- "hello world"
myChar
```

```{r}
class(myChar)
```

## Common data structures in R


| Dimension | Homogeneous | Heterogeneous |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 1d | Atomic Vector | List |
| 2d | Matrix | Data frame |
| nd | Array | - | 

### Atomic Vector
There are four common types of atomic vectors that we will discuss here: numeric (aka double), integer, character, and logical. As you can tell we are familiar with all these types. Vectors in R are collections of data types, all the elements of a vector have the same type.

Atomic vectors are typically created with c(), short for combine:

```{r}
numVec <- c(0.01, 5, 90)
numVec
class(numVec)
```

```{r}
intVec <- c(1L, 5L, 9L)
intVec
class(intVec)
```

```{r}
charVec <- c("a", "b", "abc-xyz")
charVec
class(charVec)
```

```{r}
boolVec <- c(T, F, FALSE, TRUE)
boolVec
class(boolVec)
```

We can use `length()` on any of these vectors to get their length:

```{r}
length(numVec)
```

```{r}
length(boolVec)
```

Check the type of a vector with "is" functions: `is.character()`, `is.numeric()`, `is.integer()`, `is.logical()`, or, more generally, `is.atomic()`:

```{r}
is.numeric(numVec)
```

```{r}
is.atomic(numVec)
```

```{r}
is.character(numVec)
```

#### Coercion
If you try to combine different data types together by `c()`, R will automatically coerce:

```{r}
c('foo', 'bar', 4)
```

```{r}
c(TRUE, 3, FALSE)
```

Note: You will usually get a warning message if the coercion might lose information. If confusion is likely, explicitly coerce with `as.character()`, `as.double()`, `as.integer()`, or `as.logical()`.

```{r}
as.integer(c(1.2, 5, 9.0))
```


#### Missing values
Missing values are noted with NA:

```{r}
c(1, NA, 8)
```

## List
Lists are similar to vectors with the major difference that their elements can contain any types, including lists. We make them by `list()`:

```{r}
myList <- list(5, "Sample character element", TRUE, c(2.71, 3.14), list("a", 6))
myList
```

You can use function `str()` to compactly display the internal **str**ucture of an R object:

```{r}
str(myList)
```

```{r}
class(myList)
```

Accessing elements in a list:

```{r}
myList[[4]]
```

```{r}
myList[[4]][[2]]
```

```{r}
myList[[5]]
```

```{r}
myList[[5]][[1]]
```

#### Names
Elements of a vector can have names. These names can be set in the creation of the vector or later by `names()`:

```{r}
x <- 1:3
x
```

```{r}
names(x)
```

```{r}
names(x) <- c('a', 'b', 'c')
```

```{r}
x
```

```{r}
names(x)
```

Instead of doing this in two separate steps, we set the names at the time that we create the vector:

```{r}
x <- c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)
x
```

```{r}
highTemps <- c(96, 88, 94, 78, 85, 90, 72)
highTemps
days <- c("Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun")
names(highTemps) <- days
highTemps
```

```{r}
highTemps['Mon']  # accessing the element and its name by calling its name
```

```{r}
highTemps[['Mon']]
```


### Factors
Factors are a type of vector that contain only predefined values. It is used to store categorical data. For example:

```{r}
genderVec <- c('f', 'f', 'm', 'f', 'm')
genderVec
```

```{r}
(gender <- factor(genderVec, levels = c('m', 'f')))
```

```{r}
# modifying an element
gender[1] <- 'm'
gender
```

factors won't allow a modification that is not a part of `levels`
```{r}
gender[2] <- 'x'
gender
```

```{r}
# checking the levels
levels(gender)
```

# Matrix and Array
Matrices are a special case of a multi-dimensional array, with 2d. 

```{r}
a <- matrix(1:9, ncol = 3, nrow = 3)
a
```

```{r}
b <- matrix(1:9, ncol = 3, nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)
b
```

```{r}
c <- array(1:12, c(2, 3, 2))
c 
```

Note that a 2d array is a matrix
```{r}
array(1:9, c(3, 3))
```

```{r}
class(array(1:9, c(3, 3))) 
```

Naming columns and rows:

```{r}
mat <- matrix(1:6, 
              nrow = 2, ncol = 3, 
              dimnames = list(c("ROW1", "ROW2"),
                              c("COL1", "COL2", "COL3")))
mat
```

Accessing matrix elements:

```{r}
mat[1, ]
```

```{r}
mat[, 1]
```

```{r}
mat[, 'COL2']
```

Manipulating matrix elements:

```{r}
mat[1,2] <- 40
mat
```

```{r}
# dimensions
dim(mat)
```

```{r}
nrow(mat)
```

```{r}
ncol(mat)
```

```{r}
rownames(mat)
```

```{r}
colnames(mat)
```

```{r}
dimnames(mat)
```

```{r}
# manipulating the names
dimnames(mat) <- list(c('A', 'B'), c('X', 'Y', 'Z'))
mat
```

```{r}
# To transpose a matrix
t(mat)
```

### Data frame
A data frame is the most common way of storing data in R. Under the hood, a data frame is a list of equal-length vectors, so it is a 2-dimensional data structure.

A data frame has attributes such as `colnames()`, `rownames()`, `ncol()`, `nrow()`, `str()`

```{r}
df <- data.frame(x = 1:3, 
                 y = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), 
                 z = c("a", "b", "c"))
df
```

```{r}
str(df)
```

```{r}
glimpse(df)
```

Character variables passed to `data.frame` are converted to factor columns unless specified by `stringsAsFactors = FALSE`:

```{r}
df <- data.frame(x = 1:3, y = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), z = c("a", "b", "c"), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
str(df)
```

**Slicing and indexing** 
Getting a subset of a `data.frame`

```{r}
df$y  # column y
```

```{r}
df[1]  # first column, a data.frame subset
```

```{r}
df[[1]]  # returns the first column as a vector
```

```{r}
df[2,]  # 2nd row
```

```{r}
df[2,3]  # 2nd row, 3rd column element
```

```{r}
df[c(2,3), c(1,2)]  # intersection of 2nd and 3rd rows with 1st and 2rd columns
```

Subsetting vectors:

```{r}
v1 <- 10:20
names(v1) <- letters[1:11]
v1
```

```{r}
v1[1]
```

```{r}
v1[[1]]
```

```{r}
v1[5:8]
```

```{r}
v1[c(1,3)]
```

#### Combining data frames
`cbind()` and `rbind()` can be used to combine two or more `data.frame`s, by column and row respectively.

```{r}
m <- cbind(1, 1:5)  # the '1' (= shorter vector) is recycled
m
```

```{r}
cbind(m, 6:10)  # insert a column
```

```{r}
df1 <- data.frame(series = 1, Letter = letters[1:3], number = 1:3)
df1
df2 <- data.frame(series = 2, Letter = LETTERS[4:6], number = 10:12)
df2
rbind(df1, df2)
```

Note: In order for this to work all the column names should match. We will see how to merge data.frames if the names don't match in the future notebooks.

Non-matching names result in error:

```{r}
df1 <- data.frame(A = 1, number = 1:3)
df2 <- data.frame(B = 2, number = 10:12)
#rbind(df1, df2)
```
> Error in match.names(clabs, names(xi)) : names do not match previous names

## Mathematical Operations

```{r}
v1 <- c(1, 2, 5)
v2 <- c(3, 4, 2)
v1 + v2
```

```{r}
v1 * v2
```

```{r}
v1 / v2
```

```{r}
10 * v1
```

```{r}
sum(v2)
```

```{r}
mean(v1)
```

```{r}
prod(v1)
```

---

```{r}
mat <- matrix(1:9, byrow = T, ncol = 3)
mat
```

```{r}
mat * 2
```

```{r}
mat + 10
```

```{r}
colSums(mat)
```

```{r}
rowSums(mat)
```

```{r}
rowMeans(mat)
```

## Comparison operators

```{r}
2 > 1
```

```{r}
10 == 10
```

```{r}
4 >= 5
```

```{r}
x = 12
y = 10

x != y  # checks if x is not equial to y. If not equal then returns TRUE!
```

```{r}
v1 <- 10:20
names(v1) <- letters[1:11]
v1
```

```{r}
v1 > 15  # returns a logical vector
```

```{r}
# Filtering elements that are greater than 15
v1[v1 > 15]
```

### Exercise 2
Stock price matrix - follow the steps outlined below to create a matrix with some mocked data. Assume the closing price for each day of the week for these companies are given as below:

| Comp/Day | Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| GOOG | 1205 | 1248 | 1263 | 1268 | 1238 |
| AMZN | 1802 | 1829 | 1863 | 1808 | 1817 |

For each company create a vector that contains all the values for that company. Use the symbol as names for these vectors

```{r}
# your code goes here
```

Create a vector containing weekdays, call it `days`

```{r}
# your code goes here
```

Assign `days` vector as names to all the vectors you created earlier

```{r}
# your code goes here
```

Now using `rbind()` combine these two vectors into a matrix and call it stocksPrices

```{r}
# your code goes here
```

We just got FB data for those days, let's add this to our matrix

| Comp/Day | Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| FB   | 210 | 214 | 217 | 176 | 174 |

```{r}
# your code goes here
```

Your matrix should look something similar to 

| Comp/Day | Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| GOOG | 1205 | 1248 | 1263 | 1268 | 1238 |
| AMZN | 1802 | 1829 | 1863 | 1808 | 1817 |
| FB   | 210 | 214 | 217 | 176 | 174 |

Let's add a new column to this matrix to capture the average value of stocks for the week for each company. Use the function `rowMeans()` to calculate the average value of each row, call this new column `average`

```{r}
# your code goes here
```

You can access an entire column by `stocksPrices[,<COLUMN NUMBER or NAME>]`. Print the slice of data for `Mon` and `Fri` separately. Then create a new column called `percentageGain` and using those slices calculate and populate week's gains (in percentage) for these companies

```{r}
# your code goes here
```

---

## Tibbles
Tibbles are basically refined data frames, but they tweak some older behaviors to make life a little easier.

**tibble** is one of the libraries that come with tidyverse. In order to use its functionalities you can load either one of these packages.

Some of the features of tibble:

* Tibbles have clean printing method that shows only the first 10 rows and all the columns that fit on the screen
* When printed, the data type of each column is specified
* Subsetting a tibble will always return a tibble

To convert a `data.frame` to tibble use `as_tibble()`:

```{r}
as_tibble(iris)
```

You can create a new tibble from individual vectors with `tibble()`:

```{r}
myTibble <- tibble(x = 1, 
                   y = 1:5, 
                   z = y ^ 2 + x
                  )

myTibble
```

The `mpg` dataset from ggplot2 that we worked before is a tibble, like all other datasets that come with tidyverse.
```{r}
mpg
```

This is what class() function will output for a traditional data.frame:
```{r}
class(mtcars)
```

```{r}
class(ggplot2::mpg)  # And this is what it'll show for a tibble data.frame
```

In the examples below you can compare the behavior of a data.frame right next to its corresponding tibble:

```{r}
df <- data.frame(abc = 1, xyz = "a")
df$xyz
df[, "xyz"]
df[, c("abc", "xyz")]
```

```{r}
df <- tibble(abc = 1, xyz = "a")
df$xyz
df[, "xyz"]
df[, c("abc", "xyz")]
```

---

### Exercise 3
If you have the name of a variable stored in an object, e.g. `var <- "hwy"`, how can you extract the reference variable from a tibble?

```{r}
# Your answer goes here
```
